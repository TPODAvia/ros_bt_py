# Dev to Master Sync YYYY-MM-DD

Before doing the sync merge make sure all items below are checked:
- [ ] Rebase dev to master to make sure there are no merge conflicts upstream
- [ ] Check if commit history since last merge is acceptable
- [ ] Check if CHANGELOG.md is updated with all changes to be merged into master
- [ ] Check if all changes that need further documentation are well documented
- [ ] After Sync: Rebase dev to include last merge commit
